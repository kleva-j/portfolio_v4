### About Binary Search

Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half, comparing the target value to the middle element of the interval. If the target value matches the middle element, the search is complete. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the interval. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the `interval`. The process repeats until the target value is found or the search interval is empty.

### Implementation

```ts app/page.tsx
function binarySearch(arr: number[], target: number): number {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    if (arr[mid] === target) {
      return mid;
    } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return -1;
}
```

```ts server/jstack.ts {1,7}
import { jstack } from 'jstack';

interface Env {
  Bindings: { DATABASE_URL: string };
}

export const j = jstack.init<Env>();

/**
 * Public (unauthenticated) procedures
 * This is the base part you use to create new procedures.
 */
export const publicProcedure = j.procedure;
```

```tsx app/page.tsx
const res = await client.post.recent.$get();
const post = await res.json();
// ^ automatically type-safe: { post: Post }
```

### Another Implementation

```bash Terminal
npx wrangler deploy server/index.ts
```

---

### Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

---

### Example

```ts {4-10} server/routers/post-router.ts
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const target = 3;
const result = binarySearch(arr, target);
console.log(result); // Output: 2
```

### Applications

- Searching for an element in a sorted array
- Finding the index of a target element
- Implementing a binary search algorithm

---

### Limitations

- Only works on sorted arrays
- Requires random access to elements (not suitable for linked lists)
- May have worse performance than linear search for very small arrays due to overhead

---

### Conclusion

Binary search is a simple and efficient search algorithm that excels with large sorted datasets. It provides logarithmic time complexity, making it ideal for scenarios where fast lookup is required on sorted data.
